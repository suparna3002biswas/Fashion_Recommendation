This project repo contains details of our fashion reccomendation project.
Here we are using Streamlit for the web interface.

We are using 3 CNN models: i) DenseNet201
                          ii) MobileNetV2
                          iii) Xception

Then we are doing sof voting ensemble with these 3 models and it recommends the correct occasion and similar images from uploaded user image.
And, additionally our recommendation system shows images based on user choice occasion.

Here, we have made a dataset with real time images used it in our project.
